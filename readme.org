  Setting up my first blog. This is a work in progress.

** Building and Running

*** Get Build Tools

    Either get nix to automatically pull in all the dependencies including the
    compiler:

    1. Get nix: https://nixos.org/nix/
    2. Enter a nix shell ~nix-shell~ in the root of this project.

    Or follow this guide to install either Cabal and GHC or Stack (which will
    pull the correct GHC version): https://www.haskell.org/platform/

*** Build and Run

    1. Build and Run with ~cabal new-run site watch~
    2. Visit ~localhost:8000~
